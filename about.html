## About

I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. Right now, I am the Head of Mobile and Web Engineering at Velocity.
I specialize in mobile and web performance optimization, prototyping, and building Mobile (Android/iOS) and web applications.

I love the opportunity to solve incredibly difficult problems with few resources - that is what ingites innovation in a company.
