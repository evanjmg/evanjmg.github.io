## About

I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. I'm currently working as a Front End Web Developer at Velocity.


 I specialize in growth-hacking, performance optimization, prototyping mobile apps, and building Angular 4, React, React Native, Webpack, Node/Express applications.

I am interested in cool front-end frameworks, start ups, and machine learning. I love to implement cutting-edge technology into the workplace and to learn new approaches to problems.
