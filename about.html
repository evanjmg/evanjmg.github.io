## About I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. Right now, I
am a Senior Front End Developer at Teckro. For the last 5 years, I have specialized in mobile and
web performance optimization, prototyping, and building web applications. I also have two plus years
of experiences build native mobile (Android/iOS) applications and leading a mobile team. I love the
opportunity to solve incredibly difficult problems with few resources - that is what ingites
innovation in a company. If you have any questions or would like to talk, please message me on
