## About

I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. I'm currently looking for full-time full-stack web development work in London starting in May. I will be graduating with an MSc in International Marketing from GCU London. Right now, I am working at Great Little Place as a full-stack developer, improving their API and building awesome apps and conducting my dissertation study on startups. My experience also includes General Assembly's 12-week immersive.  I specialize in prototyping mobile apps and building Angular, Node/ExpressÂ and Ruby On Rails Apps.

 I am interested in cool front-end frameworks, start ups, and machine learning. I love to implement cutting-edge technology into the workplace and to learn new approaches to problems.
