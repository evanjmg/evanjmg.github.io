## About

I love developing digital products. This summer, I joined General Assembly's 12-week immersive and expanded my coding skill set. Right now, I am looking for part-time full-stack programming work in London. I specialize in prototyping mobile apps and building Node/ExpressÂ and Ruby On Rails Apps.

Currently, I am interested in cool front-end frameworks, start ups, and machine learning. I love to implement cutting-edge technology into the workplace and to learn new approaches to problems.
