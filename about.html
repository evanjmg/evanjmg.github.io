## About

I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. I'm currently looking for full-time full-stack web development work in London starting in May. I will be graduating with an MSc in International Marketing from GCU London. Right now, I am working at Great Little Place as a full-stack developer, improving their API and building awesome apps. At GCU London, I'm also conducting my dissertation study on startups and their web analytics. 

My experience also includes General Assembly's 12-week immersive, 1 year in digital marketing, and an Honors Bachelors Degree in both Economics and Film Studies.  I specialize in growth-hacking, performance optimization, prototyping mobile apps, and building Angular, Node/ExpressÂ and Ruby On Rails Apps.

I am interested in cool front-end frameworks, start ups, and machine learning. I love to implement cutting-edge technology into the workplace and to learn new approaches to problems.
