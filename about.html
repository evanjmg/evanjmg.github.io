## About

I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. Right now, I am a Front End Developer at Ryanair.
I specialize in mobile and web performance optimization, prototyping, and building web applications.
I also have two plus years of experiences build native mobile (Android/iOS) applications and leading a mobile team.

I love the opportunity to solve incredibly difficult problems with few resources - that is what ingites innovation in a company.
