## About

I love developing digital products. This summer, I am coding with  General Assembly in an 12-week immersive and looking for full-time programming and product development work in London this Fall.I specialize in prototyping mobile apps and building Node/Express and Ruby On Rails Apps.

Currently, I am interested in development, start ups, and machine learning. I love to implement cutting-edge technology into the workplace and learn new programs.
