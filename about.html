## About

I love developing fun products and contributing to the open source community. I'm currently working as a Front End Web Developer  at Velocity. I recently finished the large website at Velocity and previous worked at Great Little Place.


 I specialize in growth-hacking, performance optimization, prototyping mobile apps, and building Angular 2, Webpack, Node/ExpressÂ and Ruby On Rails Apps.

I am interested in cool front-end frameworks, start ups, and machine learning. I love to implement cutting-edge technology into the workplace and to learn new approaches to problems.
