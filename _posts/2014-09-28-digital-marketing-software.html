Whether you're a beginner or expert, each of these applications are a must have when it comes to your digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Here are my recommendations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"><em>Google Analytics</em></a> can handle a multitude of campaigns and even project future sales with goal conversion. You can track page views, demographics, user flow, browsers, location, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quantcast.com">Quantcast</a> is another option that many companies use. Unfortunately, the data is publicly displayed. However, the demographics are very in-depth.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Management</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> is best suited for managers who aren't interested in special features, but want to see simple and comprehensive analytics. I prefer Buffer because it does not</p>
<p><a href="http://hootsuite.com">Hootsuite</a> is best suited for active social media managers who want to have many features. I'd use Hootsuite if I needed special reports. RSS Feeds are included with Hootsuite, but I wouldn't recommend using this all-in-one approach.</p>
<p><strong>RSS Feeds:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a> is simple and easy to use. Plus, they have a mobile app which allows you to copy links and share to social media.</p>
<p><strong>Link Shortener:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bitly.com">Bitly </a>is by far the best link shortener and I'd try to get a domain specific link shortener. E.g: The Better Business Bureau uses go.bbb.org.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Monitoring Applications</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://mention.com">Mention</a> is one of the priciest, but it's darn good at finding consumers who are commenting on your product or service.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> is a free alternative to Mention. It's not the most advanced out there. There are numerous sites than can do current keyword searches for content, just google social media monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Design and Editing</strong></p>
<p>For Print: <a href="http://adobe.com"><em>Adobe InDesign</em></a><br />
For Photo Editing: <a href="http://adobe.com"><em>Adobe Photoshop</em> </a></p>
<p>For Video Editing: <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a> is my personal favorite. It's simple and easy to use. The keyframing is a lot easier than Adobe Premiere and it's layout is easy to grasp. The video playback is not as good as Premiere, but I prefer editing in final cut because the timeline is a lot easier to edit. However, I recommend buying the entire Adobe suite and sticking with Adobe Premiere if your business wants to save money.</p>
<p>For Audio: <a href="http://adobe.com">Audition </a>or<a href="https://www.apple.com/support/soundtrackpro/"> Soundtrack </a> are excellent options for reducing extra noise etc.</p>
<p>For Wireframe Design: <em><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">Omnigraffle</a> </em>is the simplest design program out there. What takes an hour in Illustrator, can take a couple of minutes in Omnigraffle. Making arrows is intuitive and the workflow is straightforward.</p>
<p>This is only a short list of the many applications I use on a daily basis. I'll be adding more if any come to mind. If you have any suggestions leave a comment below.</p>
