<p>Need to find a great food spot or brewery in Sacramento? Take a look at this list of eateries, breweries, bars, clubs, and late night munchies to satisfy your food &amp; drink cravings:</p>
<p><strong>Dinner (Aka Before heading to the bars):</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://hookandladder916.com/">Hook &amp; Ladder - $$$</a>: A high end, yet relaxing, downtown eatery with good drinks, pizzas, pastas, and burgers. Sit outside in the back on a large wooden circular table with friends. You'll have a great time planning your next move on the night out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jacksurbaneats.com/" target="_blank">Jacks Urban Eats - $</a>: Want a full gourmet meal without paying a lot for it? Get large meat and veg loaded salads, steak, mash potatoes, macaroni, and more at this affordable order-then-sit cafe. The urban fries are glorious.</p>
<p><a href="http://kathmandukitchen.com/" target="_blank">Katmandu Kitchen - $$</a>: If you can stomach Indian food before a night out, I recommend Katmandu for its thick creamy curries, excellent palak paneer, and tandoori chicken. It's my favorite Indian food place in Sac and it's right on broadway &amp; 17th near the heart of downtown.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.towercafe.com/TowerDinner.htm" target="_blank">Tower Cafe - $$</a>: If your friends disagree over types of food, Tower Cafe will make all of them happy. The menu includes Thai, American, Jamaican, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petragreek.com/" target="_blank">Petras - $</a>: Quick Greek food that is really filling and affordable. The plates are massive and the lamb is flavorful. You can sit down or take it to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamiesbroadwaygrille.com/" target="_blank">Jamie's Grill - $$</a>: An Irish pub that has a killer garlic steak sandwich.  Their onion rings and sides are superb.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paesanos.biz/" target="_blank">Paesanos Italian - $$ </a>- With flavorful gourmet pizza and a trendy crowd, great before walking over to the bars and clubs.</p>
<p><strong>Breweries (They Close Early):</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://track7brewing.com/" target="_blank">Track 7 </a>-$: A young, yet well known expanding brewery, located a couple miles away from downtown. Their IPAs are crisp,  almost perfect.  I recommend taking out Urban Fries and some sides from Jacks Urban Eats and eating at the brewery. Popular food trucks often stop there as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Rubicon </a>- $: The perfect brewery with nightlife combo. Get a beer and meal here then walk one block over to most of the major clubs &amp; bars. The beer is good, food not so much.</p>
<p><a href="http://ruhstallerbeer.com/" target="_blank">Ruhstaller Tap Room</a>- $$: Unique tap room experience with high-end local beer in downtown.  They claim you need an appointment, but many claim you can just walk in.</p>
<p><a href="http://bikedogbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Bike Dog </a>- $: A pleasant West Sacramento brewery with great selection and food trucks available.</p>
<p><a href="http://newhelvetiabrew.com/" target="_blank">New Helvetia</a> -$: Get a flight a this brewery on broadway. The beer is good and sure is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Pubs/Beer Gardens:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://foxandgoose.com/" target="_blank">Fox &amp; Goose (English Pub)</a> -$: I've lived in London and this pub is the closest you'll get to the real thing in Sacramento. Real English ales, great atmosphere, and decent food.</p>
<p><a href="http://streetsoflondon.net/" target="_blank">Streets of London (English Pub)</a>- $: Some English ales, excellent fried food, and conveniently located downtown so you can pop in before going to the clubs. Not as traditional as Fox &amp; Goose, nor as good of beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lowbrausacramento.com/" target="_blank">Low Brau (German Beer Hall)</a> -$: Trendiest venue for millennials right now. Good beer &amp; food. Excellent location. You'll find also a good looking crowd as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://pangaeabiercafe.com/" target="_blank">Pangaea (Gastropub)</a>- $$: I argue that it has the best beer selection in Sacramento. They have sours, IPAs, Belgiums, and more.  Gourmet meals and sides are available.</p>
<p><a href="http://beergardensacramento.com/" target="_blank">Biergarten (German Beer Garden)- $:</a> Best outdoor downtown venue. Best German beer available in Sacramento, lots to choose from, and decent food as well. Play corn hole or ping pong or just get a large glass of easy to drink german beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://tankhousebbq.com/menu" target="_blank">Tank House- $$: </a>Another good beer and greasy food joint close to all the bars and clubs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bars:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zebraclubbarsacramento.com/" target="_blank">Zebra Club</a>: Get really cheap strong mixed drinks here or get a PBR, near Press Club for a cheap night out.</p>
<p><a href="http://pourhousesacramento.com/" target="_blank">Pour House: </a> Catch some live music and get your own group draft, but prepare to walk a couple of blocks back to K.</p>
<p><a href="http://divebarsacramento.com/" target="_blank">Dive Bar</a>: Watch mermaids above the bar swim as you sip a beer or cocktail. This K street establishment</p>
<p><a href="http://shadyladybar.com/" target="_blank">Shady Lady</a>: Go back to the roaring 20s, enjoy classy specialty cocktails, and eat some amazing</p>
<p><strong>Gay Bars:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mercantile-saloon-sacramento" target="_blank">Mercantile Saloon</a>- $: really stiff cheap drinks that will make you regret you ordered it. They free pour if you know what that means.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedepot.net/" target="_blank">The Depot</a>-$: Play some pool or meet a friend right next to the Badlands. They also host drag shows and watch new episodes of RuPauls drag race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clubs: </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.faces.net/" target="_blank">Faces (Gay) $$</a>: Large,  many rooms for different crowds, although not as many hotties as Badlands. Go early and you may get in free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sacbadlands.com/" target="_blank">Badlands (Gay)</a> $$: Good-looking crowd, jello shots, go-gos, and cute boys and girls. You'll never want to leave.</p>
<p><a href="http://theparkdowntown.com/home.html" target="_blank">The Park $$$:</a> Great for a chat or a dance. This trendy bar/club is for people who want to dance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mixdowntown.net/" target="_blank">The Mix $$$</a>: Older crowd,  interesting atmosphere, good siting areas, but don't expect good music.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepressclub" target="_blank">Press Club $</a>: Great music (classics of hip-hop, RnB), cheap cover, and cheap drinks. Simple, fun, refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>Late Night Munchies:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mels-diner-sacramento-2" target="_blank">Mels Diner</a>-$$: Almost Everything  American is on the menu. Sit down, choose, and you'll be in heaven. I recommend the Monte Cristo Sandwich.</p>
<p><a href="http://williesburgers.com/" target="_blank">Willies</a>-$: My favorite chili-cheese burger in Sacramento. Top it off with season salt and a side of chili-cheese fries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/jack+in+the+box+sacramento/@38.580352,-121.4489605,13z/data=!3m1!4b1?sa=X&amp;ei=CdWEVIK1IdWyoQSA5YCIAQ&amp;ved=0CDsQtwM" target="_blank">Jack in the Box</a>-$: Oreo shake &amp; Cheap Tacos! Find a local jack in the box and your night will end right (if you can stomach the morning pain).</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/117816698630724569075/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">La Garnacha</a> or <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/carolinas-mexican-food-sacramento" target="_blank">Carolinas</a>-$: These taquerias are heavy, but wonderfully greasy. Just gorge your heart out after a long night of clubbing to one of their burritos.</p>
<p><a class="biz-name" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tako-korean-bbq-sacramento?osq=late+night+food" data-hovercard-id="zaSItYyDjqR2bewTxtssOw">Tako Korean BBQ</a> -$: I've heard a lot of good things about this place. They stay open late. So if you can handle it with your stomach,  try it out.</p>
